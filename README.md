# React Calculator

A basic react calculator that utilizes mathjs to evaluate complex string expressions. On page load and button press, the input field is focused to allow for easy typing on computers, which reduces the need for complex key-maps/event-listers. The history is clickable, allowing for re-populating the input field with past expressions or adding the results of expressions to your current input.
